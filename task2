# Hotel Management System

## Overview

This project is a Hotel Management System developed during my internship at CodeAlpha. It is built using Java Swing for the user interface and integrates with a database to manage hotel information and customer ratings.

## Features

- **Hotel Listings**: Displays a list of hotels along with their locations and average ratings.
- **Hotel Ratings**: Allows customers to rate hotels and view average ratings.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with error handling for incorrect passwords and duplicate hotel entries.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL (or any other relational database)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-management-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hotel-management-system
    ```
3. Set up the database:
    - Create a database and import the provided SQL schema and data.
    - Update the `DatabaseHelper.java` file with your database connection details.

4. Compile and run the application:
